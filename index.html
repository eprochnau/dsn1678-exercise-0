	<p>A bundle of organic beets from a local farm food co-op program.
	
	55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root.
	The usually deep purple roots of <strong>beetroot</strong> are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a
	cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and
	shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.</p>
